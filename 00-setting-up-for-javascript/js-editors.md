# Which Editor to use for JavaScript

> wip

There are many editors out there, and people are very, very precious about what they use. It's definitely worth trying out different editors, configuring them and seeing what works for you.  
That said, some of the most popular editors for JavaScript are:

- [sublime text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [atom](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [webstorm by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

Essentially if you are already using one of these, you can continue to use them for JavaScript and you'll get on fine (if you come from inteliJ or any other Jetbrains program, webstorm will likely feel the most natural for you)

If you don't use any of these, then of the four my personal suggestion would be [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is arguably the best out of the box and has some of the best JavaScript and typescript intlisense with minimal set up. It's growing in popularity too so you're likely to see this become the editor of choice for js.
