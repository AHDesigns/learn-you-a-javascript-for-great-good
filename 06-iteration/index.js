// try to complete both excercises with a for loop and a while loop

// write a factorial function taking one argument which returns it's factorial result
// eg factorial 4 would be 24 (1 x 2 x 3 x 4) = 24

// write a fibonacci sequence generator that when given an argument n
// returns the nth number in the fibonacci sequence
// eg fibonacci given n = 1 should return 1, as 1 is the 1st number
// in the fibonaci sequence
